# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy details how data is collected for the Revolution Idle Wiki Bot to function.

If you have any questions or queries regarding this, please contact `@septikai` in the Revolution Idle Wiki Discord, found [here](https://discord.gg/MqCUeysH5W).

## Data We Collect

The Revolution Idle Wiki Bot does not collect any personal information or data. The bot collects exclusively public data such as the Server ID of servers it is added to, along with any Channel or Role IDs you provide it.

### Why Are We Collecting This Information?

We collect this information to allow the bot to function differently in each server. Some features may work differently in different guilds, which requires us to collect unique identifiers to determine how it should work in that specific guild.

### How Is This Data Protected?

All collected data is kept secure in our database. This data will never be misused or shared with anyone, and will exclusively be used by the bot.

### How Long Is This Data Stored

All data collected by the bot will be stored for up to 14 days after the bot is removed from the guild in question.

This cannot be restored if the bot is re-added later.

### How Can You See/Delete Your Data?

Your data will automatically be deleted within 14 days of the bot being removed from your guild. You may request a copy or the manual removal of your data by contacting `@septikai` in the Revolution Idle Wiki Discord. You will need to prove you are an administrator in the guild in question for this request to be completed.

Once deleted, your data cannot be restored.
